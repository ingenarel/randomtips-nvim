### This plugin isn't finished yet.

Questions that you may have:
- When will it be finished?
    When I complete reading and understanding the full docs. But I do try to update it regularly though.
- Why am I not just writing a parser for vimdocs and just extract the motion and the data?
    Because this is not just a personal project, it's also my journey reading and understanding the docs itself
