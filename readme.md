### this plugin isn't finished yet.

questions that you may have:
- when will it be finished?
    when i complete reading and understanding the full docs. but i do try to update it regularly tho.
- why am i not just writing a parser for vimdocs and just extract the motion and the data?
    because this is not just a personal project, it's also my journey reading and understanding the docs itself
